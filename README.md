# Cloud Founry Interaction Library

CF Go package makes it easier to interact with Cloud Foundry v2 instances. It provides higher level API to perform basic
actions over REST API. 

The REST API of Cloud Foundry is not documented yet, so all the functionality is implemented by reverse engineering 
official CF client written in Ruby (http://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf).

## Usage
The usage of this library is demonstrated in `cf90` CLI tool (http://github.com/igm/cf90)

This project is work in progress.
